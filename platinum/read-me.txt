EASY!APPOINTMENTS
=================================================================
Easy!Appointments is a highly customizable web application that 
allows your customers to book appointments with you via the web. 
Moreover, it provides the ability to sync your data with Google 
Calendar so you can use them with other services. It is an open 
source project and you can download and install it even for 
commercial use. Easy!Appointments will run smoothly with your 
existing website, because it can be installed in a single folder 
of the server and of course, both sites can share the same database.
